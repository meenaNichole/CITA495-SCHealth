Web Browsers do not allow HTML/JavaScript code to directly
access files on the client side because of security risk.
To develop and test Web apps we can setup a local host Web server
that lets us use our PC/notebook as if it were a remote file server.

The Python language provides such a utility.
Download and install the latest Python version (3.x or later).
Note the installation folder path.

Edit run_local.bat to refer to the installation folder of python.exe
Save run_local.bat into the home or root folder where your Web app
.HTML files reside.

double-click on the run_local.bat to launch the Python Web server
in your Web app home folder.  This will simulate the effect that 
the files in your home folder are coming from a Web server (local host).
This will allow you to test HTML/JavaScript code that refers to 
file resources located physically on your computer.
The IP address 127.0.0.1 denotes local host - or this computer.
The :8000 denotes the port number.  Change the number if another 
program on your computer uses port 8000.
