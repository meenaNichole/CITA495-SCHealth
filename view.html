                        <h3>Burns Don't Take a Holiday</h3>
                        <p>This book was created by the South Carolina AHEC in partnership with the Medical University of South Carolina Pediatric Burn Center with funding from the South Carolina Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation. In this book, we introduce two new characters. F.R.E.D. the Firehose and his buddy, Squirt, the fire plug. Since October is fire prevention month and the beginning of the holiday season, F.R.E.D and Squirt help a family create fire prevention strategies to keep them safe during the holidays.

House fires spread rapidly. Families may have as little as two minutes to escape once an alarm sounds. In 2013, more than 126,035 children across the U.S., including more than 67,000 children aged 4 and under, needed emergency treatment due to a fire or burn. Of all fire-related deaths, 87% are due to home fires and in 2013, 334 children in the U.S. died in home fires. Fires are not just a problem in the United States. Nearly 61,000 children around the world died in 2008 due to a fire or burn</p>
